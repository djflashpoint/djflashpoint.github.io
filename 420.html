  <h2>A Year on the Bottom Shelf</h2>
  <img src="img/kush.png" alt="car" style="width:100%">

          <p class="c0"><span>July 1</span><span class="c3">st</span><span class="c2">, 2017, the smell of Coffee awoke me. This was the day Cannabis became legal to buy recreationally in the State of Nevada. At the time I was making sandwiches at the local Donut chain that shall not be named. I went into work and did the old repetitious daily routine, anticipating for what would be the most memorable days of my 28 years. 1400 Hours, time to clock out of this burned out franchise. I trade it for the smoggy, hot, humid, monsoon atmosphere us Southern Nevadans call July. I make my way to Euphoria Wellness Dispensary, a mere 10 mile drive from my residence of Henderson, NV. The City of Henderson did not allow Medical Marijuana Businesses to sell Recreational Cannabis until Mid October 2017. The Weather and distance were not obstacles at all to me from buying Legal Cannabis. As I pulled into the recently built plaza, not to my surprise there was a line outside of the building. This was something I had anticipated, having only a handful of Dispensaries allowed to sell that day was a bit of a bottleneck. </span></p>
          <p
            class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fifteen minutes wasnt long of a wait, they only allow so many patrons in the building at a time, and I was finally in awe browsing the beautifully modern setup of the dispensary. Anything you can think of was being sold there on the first day. I saw Edibles, Wax, Flower, Oil, Topical Creams, and even Pet Meds. These products zapped into existence and blew my mind as if they had been conjured out of thin air right in front of me by some Marijuana Wizard. The shopping possibilities were endless, I had to come up with a quick long term financial plan for this new lifestyle of consumption. I ended up buying bottom shelf only: 3.5 Grams of Cheese and a CBD dominant disposable vaporizer pen that was a Hybrid of Ringo&#39;s Gift and Ghost OG. Both were really amazing in their own aspects, and seeing strains that were usually top shelf on the bottom shelf is what caught my eye. There was a theory behind this &ldquo;Tiered-Shelf&rdquo; business I was consuming financially and medically. In the current commercial Cannabis industry, flower product is usually in a tier system: Bottom, Middle, and Top. top shelf has the highest percentage in THC usually, but its the overall quality of the buds that determine their spot in the tier that the seller chooses. This is my theory, you really don&#39;t need to buy top shelf to find those really good nugs, the seller will always have overstock of something good and they are forced to sell it cheap before the buds start losing their freshness. So I made a decision, lets try bottom shelf only for the first year, a trial by fire, perhaps.</span></p>
            <p
              class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
              <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Every once in a while I would find a strain that masqueraded as &ldquo;Dank Buds&rdquo;, but would end up being some twiggy, headache inducing, dirt. I quickly learned to buy new unknown strains in grams or even a baby joint. Eventually after weeks of sampling flowers grown in our own backyard of Northern Nevada, I found good, reliable strains that lingered in the bottom shelf club from time to time. One particular strain, Ultimate Indica, which lives up to its name being 22% THC and very dense, sticky buds, is usually in that low tier shelf every time I walk into my now favorite Dispensary, The Source Henderson. If you are skeptical about buying any flower, don&#39;t be afraid of that bottom shelf, there are amazing flowers blooming, that culminate there.</span></p>

                <p class="c0"><span>July 16</span><span class="c3">th</span><span class="c2">, 2018, the smell of Cannabis awoke me. It has been a little more than a year since the State of Nevada has allowed the sales of Recreational Cannabis. Almost everyone in Nevada is consuming this psychoactive piece of nature. I have a new job at a much better business, better pay, a lot of productivity, much better outlook on life, and clearer goals. In moderation, this lifestyle can be a very healthy one, much like our dietary needs. You don&#39;t have to buy top shelf to achieve ultimate euphoria, you don&#39;t always have to spend top dollar on life&#39;s pleasures.</span></p>
