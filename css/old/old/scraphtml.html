     In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set the size at which we want it to render our app.
     It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our game
     - in this case, the width and height of the browser window. For performance intensive games, you can also give setSize smaller values,
     like window.innerWidth/2 and window.innerHeight/2, for half the resolution.
     This does not mean that the game will only fill half the window, but rather look a bit blurry and scaled up.

     Last but not least, we add the renderer element to our HTML document.
     This is a <canvas> element the renderer uses to display the scene to us.
